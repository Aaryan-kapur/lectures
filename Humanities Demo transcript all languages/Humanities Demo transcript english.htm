style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Hello, friends. So, we will start
with talking about Word classes. So, words, what are words? We will see, we
will understand; but just like that. What do you understand by the term word
and what are word classes? Now, see every word that is used in our writing, in
our communication, in our speaking, the things we read, and the things we
listen to. They are all words and every word as a class. We will soon see what
are word classes. </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Now see, the idea is that all of you
are doing your various technical courses, engineering courses. The idea is that
you should be well versed with the categories of words before you move on to
more advance level of written and spoken English. So, that is what we are here
for. So, we start from the fundamentals. Now there are 8 kinds of or 8
different kinds of words or parts of speech as we call them, and broadly
speaking, I am very sure you know these things; they are nouns, pronouns,
verbs, adverbs, adjectives, propositions, determiners and linking words. You
get your 8 parts of speech. Each word, every word that you hear or that you
speak can be classified thus. So, it is very important to understand especially
in academic kind of English that, how we are using these words. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:

give you an example and you may take it down. Ram has an important meeting at
work tomorrow so he is quite busy. I will repeat, Ram has an important meeting
at work tomorrow, so he is quiet busy. Now where are the nouns? As you know,
the definition a working definition of a noun is, noun is a name of a person,
place or thing. So, Ram is a noun and Ram is a name and meeting also is a noun.
Now, when I say I am meeting, so and so today then this becomes a kind of verb.
However, when we say Ram is in a meeting today or I am in a meeting today it
becomes a noun we have to understand the categories. So, same word can be used
as different kinds of parts of speech. This is important to learn. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span lang=EN
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>Now, Ram has an important meeting at
work tomorrow; again remember that work is also a noun. The reason is in this
context is a noun. He is at work, but if you say, he works hard, then is the
main verb; again remember we do not say he works hardly that is a wrong usage
of English or wrong use of English. We do not say he works hardly, hardly has a
negative connotation. So, it was;</span><span lang=EN> </span><span lang=EN
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>�he hardly worked, it means he did
not work at all. But when we mean someone works hard it means he is really very
good worker, hard worker; that is what we mean. He works hardly means; he does
not work at all;</span><span lang=EN> </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%'>�that is a the difference. Coming to the verbs in this
sentence, again let us go back to the sentence. Ram has an important meeting at
work tomorrow so he is quite busy. Now 'is' and 'has' remember in the first
part of the sentence 'has' is a verb in the second part of the sentence 'is' is
a verb. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:justify;line-height:
150%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>We are going to
see that, there is something called verb and the 'be' form, be. I will make it
better the 'be' form is falls under this particular form. So, the 'be' form
'is' is a kind of verb has, have, had, these are verbs as well. Ram is the
singular, therefore, has work. If boys are hard at work or boys have lot of
work to do, then it becomes have; has and have, singular � plural. Now, an
important meeting; 'an' is a determiner we will learn more about it. Now,
important meeting we have already seen; meeting is a noun and important is
something that adds to the meeting. What kind of a meeting? Not just casual
meeting, not just any meeting is an important meeting. So, any thing that adds
or that qualifies a noun becomes your adjective. </span></p>
